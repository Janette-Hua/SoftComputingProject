# SoftComputingProject

The project is dedicated to solving continuous optimization problem by metaheuristic algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS), Grey Wolf Optimization based Stochastic Fractal Search (GWO-SFS). There is an user interface which allows users to open a benchmark problem, create their own optimization problem, and evaluate the algorithms.
